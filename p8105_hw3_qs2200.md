Problem 1
=========

\*\* 1. Import and clean the dataset. \*\*

``` r
brfss_df = p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good","Fair", "Poor")))%>%
  arrange(response) 

##filter(topic == "Overall Health", response ==c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good","Fair", "Poor"))
##why can't we filter the rows which response is excellent to poor
```

\*\* 2. In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations? \*\*

``` r
brfss_sum = 
  group_by(brfss_df , locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(n = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>%
  filter(n == 7)
brfss_sum
```

    ## # A tibble: 7 x 2
    ##   locationabbr     n
    ##   <chr>        <int>
    ## 1 CT               7
    ## 2 MT               7
    ## 3 NH               7
    ## 4 NM               7
    ## 5 OR               7
    ## 6 TN               7
    ## 7 UT               7

The 4 states CT, MT, NH, NM, OR, TN, UT were observed at 7 locations.
