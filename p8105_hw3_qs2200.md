Problem 1
=========

**1. Import and clean the dataset.**

``` r
brfss_df = p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good","Fair", "Poor")))%>%
  arrange(response) 

##filter(topic == "Overall Health", response ==c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good","Fair", "Poor"))
##why can't we filter the rows which response is excellent to poor
```

**2. In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?**

``` r
brfss_state = 
  group_by(brfss_df , locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(n = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>%
  filter(n == 7)
```

The 7 states CT, MT, NH, NM, OR, TN, UT were observed at 7 locations.

**3. Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of observations in each state from 2002 to 2010.**

``` r
brfss_spa =
  group_by(brfss_df, locationabbr,year) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n())

ggplot(brfss_spa, aes(x = year, y = n_obs, color = locationabbr))+
  geom_line()+geom_point()+
  labs(x = "Year",
    y = "Number of observations")
```
