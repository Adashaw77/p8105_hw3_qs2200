# Problem 1

** 1. Import and clean the dataset. **
```{r problem 1.1}
brfss_df = p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good","Fair", "Poor")))%>%
  arrange(response) 

##filter(topic == "Overall Health", response ==c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good","Fair", "Poor"))
##why can't we filter the rows which response is excellent to poor
```
** 2. In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations? **
```{r problem 1.2}
brfss_sum = 
  group_by(brfss_df , locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(n = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>%
  filter(n == 7)
brfss_sum
```

The 4 states `r brfss_sum$locationabbr` were observed at 7 locations.
