Problem 1
=========

\*\* Import and clean the dataset. \*\*

``` r
brfss_df = p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good","Fair", "Poor")))%>%
  arrange(response) 

##filter(topic == "Overall Health", response ==c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good","Fair", "Poor"))
##why can't we filter the rows which response is excellent to poor
```
